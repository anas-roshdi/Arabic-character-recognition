handwritten Arabic character recognition project

We completed this project in a special topics course. 
We generated the data ourselves in collaboration with our classmates. 
In this project, we wrote code to train a model for recognizing handwritten Arabic characters.
In the src folder, there are two files: one contains the trained Sequential model, and the other contains the trained VGG16 model.
